# Database description
When a new patient comes, he/she is first registered in the database before meeting the doctor. The Doctor can update the data related to the patient upon diagnosis (Including the disease diagnosed and prescription). This organization also provides rooms facility for admitting the patient who is critical. Apart from doctors, this organization has nurses and ward boy. Each nurse and ward boy is assigned to a doctor. Also, they can be assigned to patients (to take care of them). The bill is paid by the patient with cash and E-banking. Record of each payment made is also maintained by the organization. The record of each call received to provide help and support to its existing person is also maintained.
