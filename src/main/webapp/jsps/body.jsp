    <h1>When a new patient comes, he/she is first registered in the database before meeting
    	the doctor. The Doctor can update the data related to the patient upon diagnosis 
    	(Including the disease diagnosed and prescription). This organization also provides 
    	rooms facility for admitting the patient who is critical. Apart from doctors, this 
    	organization has nurses and ward boy. Each nurse and ward boy is assigned to a doctor. 
    	Also, they can be assigned to patients (to take care of them). The bill is paid by the 
    	patient with cash and E-banking. Record of each payment made is also maintained by the 
    	organization. The record of each call received to provide help and support to its 
    	existing person is also maintained.
